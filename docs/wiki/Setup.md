Under the `OAuth Tokens` panel, yoyu should see a `Bot User OAuth Token`.
The token should start with `xoxb-`, copy it securely.

# Managing tokens

You should have an `app_token` and a `bot_token` from the above steps.

These can be configured directly on the `SlackAdapterConfig`:

```python
from csp_adapter_slack import SlackAdapterConfig

config = SlackAdapterConfig(app_token="xapp-...", bot_token="xoxb-...")
```

Alternatively, these could be stored in local files and the configuration will read them:

**.gitignore**

```raw
.app_token
.bot_token
```

**.app_token**

```raw
xapp-...
```

**.bot_token**

```raw
xoxb-...
```

```python
from csp_adapter_slack import SlackAdapterConfig

config = SlackAdapterConfig(app_token=".app_token", bot_token=".bot_token")
```

# SSL Configuration

In some environments, you might see SSL errors connecting to Slack.
You can provide a custom SSL context as the `ssl` argument to `SlackAdapterConfig`.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This example disables SSL, and is thus unsafe in general.

```python
from ssl import CERT_NONE, create_default_context
from csp_adapter_slack import SlackAdapterConfig

unsafe_context = create_default_context()
unsafe_context.check_hostname = False
unsafe_context.verify_mode = CERT_NONE

config = SlackAdapterConfig(
  app_token=".app_token",
  bot_token=".bot_token",
  ssl=unsafe_context,
)
```
