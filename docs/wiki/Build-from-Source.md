## Make commands

As a convenience, `csp-adapter-slack` uses a `Makefile` for commonly used commands. You can print the main available commands by running `make` with no arguments

```bash
> make

build                          build the library
clean                          clean the repository
fix                            run autofixers
install                        install library
lint                           run lints
test                           run the tests
```

## Prerequisites

`csp-adapter-slack` has a few system-level dependencies which you can install from your machine package manager. Other package managers like `conda`, `nix`, etc, should also work fine.

## Clone

Clone the repo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Point72/csp-adapter-slack.git
cd csp-adapter-slack
```

## Install Python dependencies

Python build and develop dependencies are specified in the `pyproject.toml`, but you can manually install them:
